        <p>Something about me:  I am a big fan of Disney.  I currently hold an annual pass to the Disney parks in Orlando as well as a membership to Disney's vacation club.  My home resort is Copper Creek cabins and Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge.  I usually go about every two to three months.  Most wonder why go to Disney so much, well there's more to see than just the parks.</p>
        <p>Coding is a career change, I originally started on a path to management where I was an IT Manager at Post Properties then took a position at General Electric to become a ServiceNow Developer.  Seems to have worked out!</p>
